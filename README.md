Several actions were taken to clean and standardize the data. More details can be found in the following sheets: Orders_, Customers_, and Products_.

**Overview of findings**

Coffee sales remained stable throughout 2019 and 2020. **A significant growth was recorded in 2021, when total sales increased by 13.6% and order quanitity by 20.2%** , which may have been due to the pandemic lockdown and the increase in online sales.

Data from January to August 2022 shows a **12%** drop in coffee sales compared to the same period in 2021. This may be a reaction to the end of the pandemic lockdown.

**Loyalty card holders generated $21,000 in sales**, which represented 41% of revenue.

Throughout the entire period, the highest sales were recorded in the United States and were four times higher than in other countries.
